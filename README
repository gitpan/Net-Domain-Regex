This module allows for parsing of text for valid looking DNS Domain Names, and
subsequent TLD, SLD, Domain and Hostname extraction.  Current status is pulling
a list of TLDs from a mozilla source, but in the future this will likely be a
manually maintained list with all known SLD names (co.uk for example).
